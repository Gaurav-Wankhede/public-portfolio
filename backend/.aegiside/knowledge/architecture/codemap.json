  "description": "This codemap documents the AegisIDE v4.0+ architecture with 3-tier hierarchical routing. TIER-1 CORE (500 tokens, always loaded): main-router + context-orchestrator. TIER-2 DOMAIN (800-1.2K tokens, on-demand): ace-router, governance-router, architecture-router. TIER-3 RUNTIME/KNOWLEDGE (1-5K tokens, task-specific): 52 runtime files (ace workflows, memory state, optimization, mona, incidents) + 21 knowledge files (constitution, architecture). This structure achieves 91% token savings vs flat architecture. Key innovations: Hierarchical routing, semantic suite consolidation, tier-aware routing, progressive disclosure pattern.",
